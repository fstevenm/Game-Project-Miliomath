## Game-Project-TrueOrFalse

I have created a game using the GUI library in Python, namely tkinter.

I made this game based on the idea of the "millionaire" game. In this game, the questions I asked were made into questions about math. That's why I gave it the name "milliomath". This game project has not really been completed. So friends who see this project, hope to finish this project into a perfect game like "millionaire". In compiling this game, I also looked at several sources from the internet.

#### This is the view of this game:

You can see this project in the folder 'Milliomath'

#### Don't forget to provide the source if you use this project!
